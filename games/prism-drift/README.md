# Prism Drift

A hyper-casual HTML5 arcade game — toggle your phase color to ghost through matching obstacles and dodge solid ones on a neon 3-lane highway.

**Play live:** https://balinti.github.io/prism-drift/

## How to Play

- **TAP CENTER** — toggle phase (Cyan ↔ Magenta)
- **TAP LEFT / RIGHT** — change lane
- **Arrow keys / A D** — keyboard lane control
- **Space / Enter** — toggle phase (keyboard)

Same color as you = **SOLID** (avoid!)
Opposite color = **GHOST** (pass through for points + streak multiplier)
Near miss = **bonus points + sparks**
